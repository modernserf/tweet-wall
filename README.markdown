#what is this?

This is a Rails app that does a twitter hashtag search and displays the results. It has two views and is intended to be used on two computers simultaneously: one to display the tweets, and one to watch them come in. The particular application that this is built for is a sideways mounted HDTV; hence the display view is rotated at a 90 degree angle.

There are still tons of bugs and undefined behavior in this app, but it works for the extremely specific scenario I have.

#TODO:
fix "delete all pending" bug

redo auto-refresh with jQuery
clean up controls display
link on main page to init app: new user (with hashtag field) -> controls page on create
replace user/1 with users.first
escape out &lt; &amp; etc

ambitious: streaming API
